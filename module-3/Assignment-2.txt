Object-Oriented Lua

Instructions:
In this assignment, you will practice implementing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Lua using metatables.

Write Lua code that defines a simple class using metatables, with attributes and methods. For example, create a class representing a "Person" with attributes like name and age, and methods for setting and getting these attributes.

Implement an inheritance scenario in Lua using metatables, where one class inherits from another. For example, create a "Student" class that inherits from the "Person" class and adds additional attributes and methods.

Create an instance of your class, demonstrate the usage of its methods, and access its attributes.

Submit your Lua code along with explanations or comments for each task.
