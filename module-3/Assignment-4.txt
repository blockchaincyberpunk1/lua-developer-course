Optional Multi-threading with Lua Lanes

Instructions:
In this optional assignment, you will explore Lua Lanes for multi-threading in Lua applications.

Write a Lua program that demonstrates the use of Lua Lanes to create and manage multiple threads that perform parallel computations. Each thread should have a specific task, and the main program should coordinate their execution.

Implement synchronization mechanisms using Lua Lanes to ensure that the threads can safely communicate and share data when necessary.

Extend your program to measure and compare the execution time of multi-threaded code versus single-threaded code for a computationally intensive task.

Submit your Lua code along with explanations or comments for each task.
