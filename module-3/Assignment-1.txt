Metatables and Metamethods

Instructions:
For this assignment, you will explore metatables and metamethods in Lua.

Write a Lua program that uses metatables to define a custom behavior for the addition (+) operator between two tables. When two tables are added, their values should be concatenated into a new table.

Implement a Lua script that demonstrates the use of metamethods, specifically the __index metamethod, to create a custom indexing behavior for a table.

Create a Lua program that uses metatables to restrict the modification of a specific table by preventing any changes to its values.

Submit your Lua code along with comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each part.
