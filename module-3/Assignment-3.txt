Lua Coroutines Exploration

Instructions:
For this assignment, you will learn about Lua's coroutine feature and practice using it for asynchronous and concurrent programming.

Write a Lua program that demonstrates the creation of coroutines and how they can be used to execute multiple tasks concurrently. Create two coroutines that perform different computations and run them concurrently.

Extend the previous program to show how coroutines can be used for asynchronous programming. Implement a coroutine that simulates an asynchronous task (e.g., a timer) and yields control back to the main program while waiting.

Create a Lua script that uses coroutines to implement a cooperative multitasking scenario, where multiple coroutines take turns executing tasks.

Submit your Lua code along with comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each part.
