Lua File Manipulation Challenge

Instructions:
For this assignment, you will work with Lua's file I/O capabilities to manipulate data in text files.

Write a Lua program that reads the content of an existing text file, manipulates the data (e.g., performs string replacements or modifications), and saves the modified content back to the same file.

Create a Lua script that reads a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file and processes its data to calculate statistics (e.g., average, maximum, minimum) for a specific column.

Submit your Lua code for both tasks along with explanations or comments describing the steps and logic you used to achieve the desired outcomes.
