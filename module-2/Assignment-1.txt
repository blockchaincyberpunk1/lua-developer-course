Lua Tables Exploration

Instructions:
For this assignment, you will explore Lua's versatile data structure, tables, and their various applications.

Create a Lua program that defines a table containing information about a fictional list of books. Include book titles, authors, and publication years.

Implement Lua code to access and print specific elements of the table, such as the title of the first book or the author of the third book.

Write a Lua function that adds a new book entry to the table, allowing the user to input the book's details.

Modify the table to remove an entry (e.g., a book) based on user input.

Submit your Lua code along with comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each part.
