Lua Table Manipulation

Instructions:
In this assignment, you will practice creating, modifying, and manipulating tables in Lua.

Create a Lua program that defines an empty table and adds at least five key-value pairs to it, representing various data types.

Write Lua code to iterate through the table and print all its key-value pairs.

Implement a Lua function that checks if a specific key exists in the table and prints a message accordingly.

Develop a Lua script that demonstrates how to merge two tables into a single table.

Submit your Lua code along with explanations or comments for each task.
