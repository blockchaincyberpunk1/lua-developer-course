Lua File I/O Practice

Instructions:
In this assignment, you will learn how to read from and write to files in Lua using the I/O library.

Create a Lua program that reads the contents of a text file named "input.txt" and prints its content to the console.

Implement a Lua script that prompts the user to enter text and saves it to a new text file named "output.txt."

Extend the previous program to append additional text entered by the user to the "output.txt" file.

Submit your Lua code along with explanations or comments for each task.
