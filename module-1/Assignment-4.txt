Lua Control Structures Exercise

Instructions:
In this assignment, you will practice working with control structures in Lua.

Implement a Lua program that uses conditional statements (if, else if, else) to determine whether a number is even or odd.

Write a Lua script that uses loops (for or while) to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.

Create a Lua program that asks the user to input a number and then prints a countdown from that number to 1 using a loop.

Submit your Lua code along with comments explaining the logic and purpose of each part.
