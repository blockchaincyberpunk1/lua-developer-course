Command-Line Application Development

Instructions:
For this assignment, you will create a command-line application using Lua to practice basic application development.

Choose a simple task or utility that can be performed via a command-line interface. For example, you can create a task manager, a calculator, or a file manipulation tool.

Develop a Lua program that accepts command-line arguments or user input to perform the chosen task.

Implement error handling and provide clear usage instructions when incorrect input is provided.

Test your command-line application with various inputs to ensure it functions correctly.

Create a brief user guide or README file that explains how to use your command-line application.

Submit your Lua code along with the user guide or README file.
