Instructions:
For this optional assignment, you will extend your skills by developing a graphical desktop application using Lua and libraries like GTK or wxLua.

Choose a simple desktop application idea, such as a text editor, a note-taking app, or a calculator.

Create a prototype or minimal version of your desktop application using Lua and the chosen graphical library (e.g., GTK or wxLua).

Implement essential features, such as creating, saving, and editing content in the application.

Ensure a user-friendly graphical interface with appropriate widgets and controls.

Test the desktop application prototype to verify its functionality.

Submit your Lua code for the desktop application prototype along with a brief description of the application's purpose and features.
