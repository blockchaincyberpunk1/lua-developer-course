Choose a Lua project or create a simple Lua script that you want to test.

Install the Busted testing framework if you haven't already.

Write a set of test cases using Busted to test various aspects of your Lua code. Ensure you cover different scenarios, including edge cases.

Run the Busted tests and observe the test results, identifying any failures or errors.

Debug and fix any issues in your Lua code based on the test results.

Document the testing process, including the purpose of each test case and any improvements you made to your Lua code.

Submit your Lua code, the Busted test suite, and the documentation of the testing process.
