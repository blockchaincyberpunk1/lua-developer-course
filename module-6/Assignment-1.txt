Git Version Control Basics

Instructions:
For this assignment, you will learn how to use Git for version control, collaboration, and tracking changes in your Lua projects.

Set up a Git repository for a new or existing Lua project. Initialize the repository and add some sample Lua files to it.

Create at least three commits with meaningful commit messages that demonstrate the process of making changes to your Lua code.

Use Git's branching and merging capabilities to create a new branch, make changes in the branch, and then merge those changes back into the main branch (usually called "master" or "main").

Create a remote Git repository on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Push your local Git repository to the remote repository.

Document the steps you followed, including commands used, in a README file in your repository.

Submit the link to your remote Git repository and the README file.
