Lua Testing and Test Automation

Instructions:
In this assignment, you will explore advanced testing concepts and test automation in Lua.

Select a Lua project (or create a new one) that you want to enhance with automated testing.

Develop an extensive set of test cases using Busted to thoroughly test various aspects of your Lua code. Include both unit tests and integration tests.

Integrate test automation into your Lua project's development workflow. Use tools like continuous integration (CI) platforms to automate the execution of your tests.

Ensure that your tests are automatically run whenever changes are pushed to your Git repository.

Document the test automation setup and workflow, including any challenges and solutions you encountered.

Submit your Lua code, the automated test suite, and the documentation of the test automation setup and workflow.
