Collaborative Git Workflow

Instructions:
In this assignment, you will practice collaborative Git workflows.

Partner with a classmate or colleague to create a shared Git repository on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

Each team member should clone the shared repository to their local machine.

Collaborate on a Lua project within the shared repository. Make changes to the code, create branches, and commit your contributions.

Use Git's pull and push commands to ensure that both team members are up-to-date with the latest changes.

Document the collaborative workflow, including how you communicated and coordinated your work.

Submit the link to the shared Git repository and a brief report on your collaborative experience.
