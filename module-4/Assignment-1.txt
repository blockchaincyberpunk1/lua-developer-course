Love2D Game Framework Basics

Instructions:
In this assignment, you will explore Love2D, a popular game framework for Lua, and practice the fundamentals of game development using Love2D.

Create a Love2D project that displays a simple game window with a background color.

Implement game logic to move a character (e.g., a square or a circle) using keyboard input (arrow keys or WASD).

Add graphics to your game by drawing shapes (e.g., rectangles, circles) and applying colors.

Implement basic collision detection between objects in your game.

Add a scoring mechanism that increments when the character collects or interacts with objects in the game.

Submit your Love2D project along with comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each part.
